Aim of project: Design of 10bit potentiometric DAC 3.3v analog voltage, 1.8v digital voltage and 1 off-chip external voltage reference@osu180nm

 **Design of PDAC**
 
 
Most of the real-world applications deal with analog and digital signal, therefore conversion from digital to analog signal and vice-versa are required to achieve a respective task in an speciﬁc application. To carryout such process of conversion digital-to-analog convertor (DAC’s) and analogto-digital converter (ADCs) are required. However, This Project  focuses on designing of potentiometric DAC(Digital to Analog Converter) where digital binary is given as a input and coressponding analog voltage is obtained.In this project Resistor String DAC (RDAC) topology is used which allows to divide the voltage using resistor-string architecture.Here two bit PDAC is implemented in 180nm CMOS Technology node.Repository consist of all schematic,netlist spice code,output waveform etc.
